# Frameworks
Someone is trying to stop Christmas this year and stop Santa from delivering gifts to children who were nice this year. 
The Best Festival Company’s website has been defaced, and children worldwide cannot send in their gift requests. 
There’s much work to be done to investigate the attack and test other systems! 
The attackers have left a puzzle for the Elves to solve and learn who their adversaries are. 
McSkidy looked at the puzzle and recognised some of the pieces as the phases of the Unified Kill Chain, a security framework used to understand attackers. 
She has reached out to you to assist them in recovering their website, identifying their attacker, and helping save Christmas.


## Unified Kill Chain
Essentially this is a framework for organziations to follow to allow them to better undertand how an attacker would progress through their attack. It generally contains 7 stages which we can use to try and progress in this exercise. 
- Recon
- Weaponize
- Delivery
- Exploit
- Install
- Command & Control
- Actions on Objective

**An example of this process might be scanning an IP or range of IP's to expose information and gain a deeper foothold (either through additional scanning/probing following network information or through a secondary step). From there we could use an Exploit to penetrate further, etc, etc...**

Who is the adversary that attacked Santa's network this year?
**The Bandit Yeti**

What's the flag that they left behind?
**THM{IT'S A Y3T1 CHR1$TMA$}**
